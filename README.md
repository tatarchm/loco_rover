# LOCORover

LOCORover is an open-source robotics platform designed for teaching the basics of Arduino robotics. It is built from standard low-cost electronic components and some custom 3D-printable parts. The platform is designed in a modular way, making it possible to assemble various configurations of wheeled robots. We provide examples of several such configurations, including assembly instructions and starter code.

The platform design is heavily ifluenced by the wonderful SMARS robot. In fact, the sensor mounts are compatible with SMARS.
